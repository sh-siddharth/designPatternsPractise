Observer pattern:
it contains example of "Notify Me" which we usually see in ecommerce site.
Suppose we want to buy an iphone. But currently it is out of stock.
So we have implement to notify subscriber using onserverPattern.

Where observer is NotificationSystem
and observable is stock product which is out of stock currently.

Basic idea is whenever stock status is changes i.e outOfStock i.e stockcount==0 to more.
In this case, subscriber must be notified.
